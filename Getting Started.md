# Getting Started

## Intro to Commands and Intro to arguments

#### 1. First Create an account on pwn.college and then go to Ubuntu terminal and type ssh-keygen -f -N''. This will have two keys key and key.pub now inorder to access the ssh you have to do**__cat key.pub__** and then copy and paste it into the website.
#### 2. Then, start the first challenge on pwn.college, and then open the terminal and type: **_ssh -i key hacker@pwn.college_** This connects pwn.college to your terminal.
#### 3. Now for the first challenge: we have to type *"whoami"* to check if it says hacker(This means pwn.college and terminal are connected) and then type in **"_Hello_"** inorder to get the flag.
#### 4. In the second challenge we get to know about echo which is synonymus to print command in programming languages so for the flag we should do : *_"Hello Hackers"_*
